        <h4>Everyone knows the weather in Florida is highly unpredictable.</h4>
        <img id="weatherImage" src="img/weather.png" alt="weather.com"/>
        <p>As shown above, weather patterns that change every hour are very common in Florida</p>
        <p>It could be 90 degrees and sunny in the morning and then there could be a torrential downpour and hour later.While you could check a weather app, that does not provide specific information regarding the temperature and the dryness of courts and playground equipment</p>
        <h3>Give it a try!</h3>
        <p>In the <a class="link" href="map.html">Maps Tab</a> there is a fully functional interactive map that will allow the user to search a park in Coral Gables, Fl and obtain relevant parks information such as weather forecasts and current playability of parks facilities. <strong>Experience When2Play right now!</strong></p>

        <h3>Wouldnâ€™t it be nice to know when to play?</h3>
        <p>Our Solution involves a network of very <strong>cheap, easy-to-install, and easily replaceable</strong> arduino computers that will be able to detect the <strong>wetness, temperature and humidity</strong> of courts, playgrounds and any other parks facilities.</p>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>One of our sensors will be placed at various locations around the park. Each sensor costs only <strong>5 Dollars</strong>. The sensors will relay <strong>real-time</strong> information to a central server located in the park office, or enclosed station. This will then be easily accessible using our <a class="link" href="app.html">mobile application</a></p>
